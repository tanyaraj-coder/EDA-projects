# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects
This repository contains multiple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects performed using Python.
Each project focuses on understanding the dataset through data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations to extract meaningful insights.

##  Projects Included

### 1️.) Housing Price EDA
Dataset: Housing dataset (CSV)
Objective:
To analyze the factors affecting house prices and understand relationships between numerical and categorical variables.

Key Analysis Performed:

+ Data loading and inspection

+ Descriptive statistics

+ Categorical variable distribution

+ Correlation analysis

+ Data visualization using count plots and heatmaps

Key Insights:

+ Price shows positive correlation with area and number of bathrooms
  
+ No extreme multicollinearity observed

+ Semi-furnished houses are the most common


### 2️.) Wine Quality EDA

Dataset: Red Wine Quality dataset
Objective:
To analyze chemical properties of wine and their impact on wine quality.

Key Analysis Performed:

+ Data structure and summary statistics

+ Missing value and duplicate checks

+ Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis

+ Distribution plots, KDE plots, box plots, violin plots, and swarm plots

+ Correlation heatmap

Key Insights:

+ Alcohol content has a strong relationship with wine quality

+ Most wines fall under quality ratings 5 and 6

+ No missing values in the dataset


### 3️.) Zomato EDA

Dataset: Zomato dataset
Objective:
To analyze restaurant trends, pricing, and customer preferences.

Key Analysis Performed:

+ Data cleaning and preprocessing

+ Exploratory analysis on ratings and cost

+ Visualization of restaurant distribution

+ Customer behavior insights

Key Insights:

+ Certain cuisines dominate the dataset

+ Price range influences customer ratings

+ Urban locations show higher restaurant density
