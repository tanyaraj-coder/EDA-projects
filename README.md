# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects
This repository contains multiple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects performed using Python.
Each project focuses on understanding the dataset through data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations to extract meaningful insights.

##  Projects Included

### 1️.) Housing Price EDA
Dataset: Housing dataset (CSV)
Objective:
To analyze the factors affecting house prices and understand relationships between numerical and categorical variables.

Key Analysis Performed:

+ Data loading and inspection

+ Descriptive statistics

+ Categorical variable distribution

+ Correlation analysis

+ Data visualization using count plots and heatmaps

Key Insights:

+ Price shows positive correlation with area and number of bathrooms
  
+ No extreme multicollinearity observed

+ Semi-furnished houses are the most common


### 2️.) Wine Quality EDA

Dataset: Red Wine Quality dataset
Objective:
To analyze chemical properties of wine and their impact on wine quality.

Key Analysis Performed:

+ Data structure and summary statistics

+ Missing value and duplicate checks

+ Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis

+ Distribution plots, KDE plots, box plots, violin plots, and swarm plots

+ Correlation heatmap

Key Insights:

+ Alcohol content has a strong relationship with wine quality

+ Most wines fall under quality ratings 5 and 6

+ No missing values in the dataset


### 3️.) Zomato EDA

Dataset: Zomato dataset
Objective:
To analyze restaurant trends, pricing, and customer preferences.

Key Analysis Performed:

+ Data cleaning and preprocessing

+ Exploratory analysis on ratings and cost

+ Visualization of restaurant distribution

+ Customer behavior insights

Key Insights:

+ Certain cuisines dominate the dataset

+ Price range influences customer ratings

+ Urban locations show higher restaurant density


### 3️.) Google Play Store EDA

Dataset: Google Play Store dataset

Objective:
To analyze mobile apps on the Google Play Store and understand popularity, installs, ratings, and category trends.

Key Analysis Performed:

+ Data cleaning and preprocessing

+ Exploratory analysis on app categories, ratings, installs, size, and price

+ Visualization of category-wise app distribution

+ Feature engineering on installs, size, and pricing

Key Insights:

+ Game and Communication apps dominate the Play Store

+ Free apps receive significantly higher installs than paid apps

+ App size impacts user ratings

+ High installs do not always mean high ratings

### 4️.) Flight Price EDA

Dataset: Flight Price Dataset

Objective:
To analyze flight ticket prices and understand how factors like airline, stops, travel class, duration, and booking time affect pricing.

Key Analysis Performed:

+ Data cleaning and preprocessing

+ Exploratory analysis on airlines, source–destination routes, and ticket prices

+ Analysis of price variation based on stops, travel class, and departure time

+ Study of booking patterns using Days Left feature

+ Visualization of price trends across airlines and routes

Key Insights:

+ Business class tickets are significantly more expensive than Economy class

+ Non-stop flights generally cost more than flights with one or more stops

+ Ticket prices increase as the travel date approaches

+ Certain airlines consistently have higher average prices

+ Longer flight duration often leads to higher ticket prices
